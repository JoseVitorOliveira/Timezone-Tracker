# Timezone-Tracker
This application allows users to select different time zones and displays the current time for each selected time zone in real-time. The project is designed to be easy to use and aesthetically pleasing, with a modern and minimalist design.

The user interface is designed with a sleek and modern aesthetic, featuring a fixed header and footer, and a main content area with a time tracking display. The application also includes interactive features such as a dropdown menu for selecting time zones, and dynamic visual elements to display the time, including a circular progress bar and an animated dot.
